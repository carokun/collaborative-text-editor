To navigate to a specific document, simply click the document's preview. 

### Document View

We built our editor component on top of the Draft.js library. The document editor allows for typing and text decoration, including font size, color, and alignment, all of which are accessible from the top toolbar. There are keyboard shortcuts built in for common commands such as bolding (⌘B), italicizing (⌘I), and saving the document (⌘S). Some of the available effects are demoed in the picture below. The document will also autosave every 30 seconds so users don't lose their work!

There is a search bar on the top right of the screen that allows users to search through their documents, highlighting the matching words and phrases.
